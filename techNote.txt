# Coverage: For mammalian TFs and chromatin modification, such as enhancer-associated
#           histone marks, which are typically localized at specific, narrow sites and
#           have on order of thousands of binding sites, 20 million reads may be 
#           adequate (4 million reads for worm and fly TFs). Proteins with more binding
#           sites, (e.g., RNA PolII) or broader factors, including most histone markers,
#           will require more reads up to  60 million for mammalian ChIP-Seq.
#           Control samples should be sequenced significantly deeper than the ChIP ones.
#

# Quality matrics of sequence reads #
#####################################

# 1. FastQC - filter low quality reads
#
# 2. end trimming - trim the low quality nucleotides at the end
#                 - sickle, https://github.com/najoshi/sickle
#
# 3. library complexity - can be corrected by systematic identification and removal 
#                         of redundant reads, which is implemented in many peak
#                         callers as it may improve their specificity.
#                       - preseq package; or 
#                       - PCR bottleneck coefficient [PBC] from ENCODE tools,

# Sequence alignment/Mapping #
##############################

# - It is important to consider the percentage of uniquely mapped reads reported by 
#   the mapper. The percentage varies between organisms, and for human, mouse, or 
#   Arabidopsis ChIP-seq data, above 70% uniquely mapped reads is normal, whereas 
#   less than 50% may be cause for concern.
# - A low percentage of uniquely mapped reads often is due either to:
#           a. excessive amplification in the PCR step;
#           b. inadequate read length;
#           c. problems with the sequencing platform; 
#           d. unavoidable for some ChIPed proteins
#              (e.g., if the protein binds frequently in repetitive DNA, which also
#              is a potential cause of high numbers of "multi-mapping" reads is that
#              the protein binds frequently in regions of repeated DNA.)
# - multi-mapping could be reduced by paired-end sequencing, and multi-mmapping reads
#   will be filtered out by most peak-calling algorithms (however, they could be novel
#   binding sites.
# - the available mappers: 
#             Bowtie
#             Bowtie2 (support gapped alignment): not necessay for most ChIP-Seq
#             BWA
#             SOAP
#             MAQ
#
# - singal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ChIP-Seq experiments to detect possible 
#   failure modes of ChIP-seq: 
#                      1. insufficient enrichment by immunoprecipitation step;
#                      2. poor fragment-size selection;
#                      3. insufficient sequencing depth. 
# - SNR can be checked by:
#   1. quality metrix, such as strand cross-correlation (built into some peak 
#      callers, e.g. SPP or MACS version 2);
#   2. IP enrichment estimation using CHANCE, comparing the IP reads pulled down
#      by the antibody and the background using the signal extraction scaling.

################
# Peak Calling #
################

# to predict the regions of the genome where the ChIPed protein is bound by
# finding regions with significant numbers of mapped reads (peaks).
#
# A fine balance between sensitivity and specificity depends on choosing an appropriate 
# peak-calling algorithm and normalization method
#
# algorithms to choose based on the type of protein ChIPed:
#   a. point-source factors such as most TFs:
#        ChIP-seq data of point-source factors are the most abundant type, 
#        most peak callers are designed and fine-tuned for these factors.
#
# Most peak-calling algorithms apply a window-based method to detect peaks,
# so nearby binding events may be erroneously merged. Peak shape is used as a clue.
#   - PeakSpliter: look for local maxima in broader region containing serveral sub-peaks
#   - GPS: probablistic model of the distribution of ChIP-seq read at given peak
#          candidate regions to deconvolve nearby homotypic events.
#   - polyaPeak (R) and NarrowPeaks (R): analyze the shape of the peaks to re-rank 
#          and narrow down the final peak list, respectively.
#   - Recommended to do a post-processing step after general peak calling for
#     point-source factors.
#
#   b. broadly enriched factors such as histone marks:
#      Some makrs are enriched strongly in narrow genomic regions (e.g., H3K4me3), 
#      however, most histone marks tend to have more broadly spreading and weaker
#      patterns (e.g., H3K27me3).
#      - SICER
#      - CCAT
#      - ZINBA
#      - RSEG
#      - Other peak callers including SPP, MACS (version 2), and ReakRanger can 
#        also be used with this type of ChIP-seq data by using their options to 
#        increase "bandwidth" or to relax the "peak cutoff."
#
#   c. those with both characteristics such as RNA Pol II; mixed signals
#      - SPP, MACS, ZINBA, PeakRanger: have options for both narrow and broad 
#                                      wpeak calling
# 
# Normalization:
# - linear: 
#     1. scaling factor to make the total reads in different samples the same.
#     2. modified version: a scale factor is estimated in a region (~10Kb) using
#        linear regression
#     3. focusing on normalization against control samples.
#        - CisGenome
#        - MACS
#        - USeq
#     4. RPKM (Reads per Kilobase of sequence range per Million mapped reads):
#        adjusts for biases due to the higher probability of reads falling into
#        longer regions.
# - nonlinear:
#     1. LOESS (locally weighted regression): assume the effect of biological
#        condition change does not cause global binding alterations.
#     2. MAnorm: assume peaks common in the two conditions do not undergo global
#        changes
#     3. POLYPHEMUS: implementing nonlinear method and a Quantile normalization
#
# Duplicate reads
#   Duplicate (identical) reads present a challenge because they can arise from
#   independent DNA fragments (signal) or by PCR amplification of a single fragment
#   (noise).

# Assessment of Reproducibility #
#################################

# Reproducibility of overall paterns
# 1. At least two biological replicates of each ChIP-seq experiments
# 2. Pearson correlation coefficient of the mapped read counts at each genomic position.
#    - 0.3 - 0.4 for unrelated samples
#    - > 0.9 for replicate samples in high-quality experiments
#    - it is important to remove artefact regions with high ChIP signals, such as
#      regions near centromeres, telomeres, satellite repeats, and ENCODE and 1000 
#      Genomes blacklisted regions, before computing the PCC.
#
# Reproducibility of peak level: IDR analysis - assess the rank consistency of 
# identical peaks between replicates (user-specified reproducibility, IDR = 0.05).
# It can be used for comparing and selection peak caller and identifying experiments
# with low quality.

# Analysis #
############

# A. Peak Annotation
#    format: BED or GFF for peaks; WIG or bedGraph for normalized read coverage
#    softwares:
#      - BEDTools: compute the distance from each peak to the nearest landmark
#      - CEAS or ChIPpeakAnno (Bioconductor): correlate with expression data or 
#                  subject to a gene ontology analysis
#
#
#
# B. Differetial Representation
# Methodologies: assume significant and reproducible peaks
#   1. simple binary overlap of two sets does not represent the optimal approach
#      when comparing peaks.
#        - BEDTools
#   2. one-qualitative-implements hypothesis testing on multiple overlapping sets 
#      of peaks, extending the two-set overlap approach.
#   3. one-qualitative-proposes the analysis of differential binding between
#      conditions based on the total counts of reads in peak regions or on the 
#      read densities
#        - DBChIP: read counts
#
#        - MAnorm: read densities; computes over peak regions, with higher computation
#                  cost, providing precise statistical assessment of differential 
#                  binding across conditions.
#                  assumes that common peaks in both conditions do not change 
#                  significantly.
#
#        - DIME: assumes a significant proportion of peaks are common to the condition
#                under comparison
#
#        - ChIPDiff: based on protein ChIPed; for histone marks
#
#        - POLYPHEMUS: based on protein ChIPed; for RNA Pol II
#
# C. Motif Identificaiton & Discovery
#   Some motif discovery algorithm form part of pipelines that perform several
#   motif analysis steps
